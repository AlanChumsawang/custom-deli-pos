## 1: Overview
The Custom Deli POS project is a project that allows deli customers to order fully customized sandwiches, all while 
practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project exemplifies best practices in OOP concepts such as 
Separation of Concerns (SOC), DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), Abstraction, Inheritance, and Effective Git Branching 
Strategies. These practices create a scalable, robust system than can be easily updated as needed.

## 2: Features
- **Create Custom Sandwiches**: Users can build their own sandwiches by choosing from a variety of bread types, sizes, and toppings. The supports both regular and premium toppings, allowing for a completely customizable sandwich experience.
- **Add Chips and Drinks**: Users can add Chips and Drinks to order for an additional charge.
- **Generate and Save Receipts**: After a user chooses to check out a receipt is generated from their created order
- **Load and Save Order History**: There is a csv names transaction history that stores all transaction. This can be used in future updates to recall old transactions on admin servers

# 3: User Stories

## 4: Lessons Learned
During the development of the Deli Order System, several advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts were applied and reinforced:

### Inheritance
Inheritance was used to create a hierarchy of classes, allowing for code reuse and a clear structure. For example, the `Product` class serves as a base class for specific product types like `Sandwich`, `Drink`, and `Chips`.

### Overriding Methods
Method overriding was utilized to provide specific implementations of methods in subclasses. For instance, the `calculateProductTotal` and `productDetails` methods in the `Sandwich`, `Drink`, and `Chips` classes override the abstract methods defined in the `Product` class.

### Overloading Constructors
Constructor overloading was employed to provide multiple ways to instantiate objects. The `Sandwich` class, for example, has multiple constructors to accommodate different initialization scenarios, such as creating a custom sandwich or a signature sandwich with predefined toppings.

These concepts helped in creating a flexible, maintainable, and scalable codebase for the Deli Order System.
