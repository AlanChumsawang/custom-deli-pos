## 1: Overview
The Custom Deli POS project is a project that allows deli customers to order fully customized sandwiches, all while 
practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project exemplifies best practices in OOP concepts such as 
Separation of Concerns (SOC), DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), Abstraction, Inheritance, and Effective Git Branching 
Strategies. These practices create a scalable, robust system than can be easily updated as needed.

## 2: Features
- **Create Custom Sandwiches**: Users can build their own sandwiches by choosing from a variety of bread types, sizes, and toppings. The supports both regular and premium toppings, allowing for a completely customizable sandwich experience.
- **Add Chips and Drinks**: Users can add Chips and Drinks to order for an additional charge.
- **Generate and Save Receipts**: After a user chooses to check out a receipt is generated from their created order
- **Load and Save Order History**: There is a csv names transaction history that stores all transaction. This can be used in future updates to recall old transactions on admin servers

## 3: User Stories

### 3.1: Customer Orders Signature Sandwich
Title: Customer Orders Signature Sandwich
As a deli customer, I want to order a signature sandwich so that I can get a good deal and not make too many decisions.
Scenario:
```
- Given the customer is at the deli order system
- When the customer selects a signature sandwich
- Then the system should add the sandwich to the order with the correct price

```
Acceptance Criteria:
```
- The system should generate a receipt with the correct total
- The system should have two signature sandwiches: "BLT" and "Philly Cheese"
- The signature sandwiches should have predefined toppings and prices
- The customer should be able to select a signature sandwich
- The selected sandwich should be visable in the order summary
- The checkout process should include the signature sandwich with the correct price 
```

### 3.2: Customer Orders Custom Sandwich
Title: Customer Orders Custom Sandwich
As a deli customer, I want to create a custom sandwich so that I can choose exactly what I want.
Scenario:
```
- Given the customer is at the deli order system
- When the customer selects add sandwich
- Then they can choose to create a fully custom sandwich

```
Acceptance Criteria:
```
- The system should prompt the customer if they want a signature sandwich
- The system should prompt the customer to select a sandwich size
- The system should prompt the customer to select a bread type
- The system should ask the customer if they want the sandwich toasted
- The system should prompt the customer to select Premium toppings
- The system should prompt the customer to select Regular toppings
- The system should prompt the customer to select sauce
- The system should ask the customer if they want extra meat
- The systems returns to order screen and displays the custom sandwich in the order summary
- When the customer checks out
- Then the system should generate a receipt with the correct total
```

### 3.3: Customer Orders Drink
Title: Customer Orders Drink
As a deli customer, I want to order a drink because I forgot to order one with my sandwich
Scenario:
```
- Given the customer is at the deli order system
- When the customer selects add drink
- Then the system should add the drink to the order with the correct price
```
Acceptance Criteria:
```
- The system should prompt the customer to select a drink size
- The system should prompt the customer to select a drink type
- The system should add the drink to the order summary
- The system should generate a receipt with the correct total
```
### 3.4: Customer Orders Chips
Title: Customer Orders Chips
As a deli customer, I want to order chips because I am still hungry after my sandwich
Scenario:
```
- Given the customer is at the deli order system
- When the customer selects add chips
- Then the system should add the chips to the order with the correct price
```
Acceptance Criteria:
```
- The system should prompt the customer to select a chip type
- The system should add the chips to the order summary
- The system should generate a receipt with the correct total
```

### 3.5: Customer Orders Multiple Items
Title: Customer Orders Multiple Items
As a deli customer, I want to order multiple items because I am very hungry
Scenario:
```
- Given the customer is at the deli order system
- When the customer selects multiple items
- Then the system should add all items to the order with the correct prices
```
Acceptance Criteria:
```
- The system should prompt the customer to select multiple items
- The system should add all items to the order summary
- The system should generate a receipt with the correct total
```


## 4: Lessons Learned
During the development of the Deli Order System, several advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts were applied and reinforced:

### Inheritance
Inheritance was used to create a hierarchy of classes, allowing for code reuse and a clear structure. For example, the `Product` class serves as a base class for specific product types like `Sandwich`, `Drink`, and `Chips`.

### Overriding Methods
Method overriding was utilized to provide specific implementations of methods in subclasses. For instance, the `calculateProductTotal` and `productDetails` methods in the `Sandwich`, `Drink`, and `Chips` classes override the abstract methods defined in the `Product` class.

### Overloading Constructors
Constructor overloading was employed to provide multiple ways to instantiate objects. The `Sandwich` class, for example, has multiple constructors to accommodate different initialization scenarios, such as creating a custom sandwich or a signature sandwich with predefined toppings.

These concepts helped in creating a flexible, maintainable, and scalable codebase for the Deli Order System.
